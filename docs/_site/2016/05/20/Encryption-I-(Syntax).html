<meta name="description" content="An encryption function is a way to transform a sequence of characters into another sequence of characters. We introduce some notation to formalize this a little bit.

These sequences of characters are often called plaintexts. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of all encrypted messages, i.e. another set of sequences of characters. These are called cyphertexts. Then an encryption function is just a function $e:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{C}$ (e stands for “encrypt”).

Note that this implies that $e$ defines a bijection between $\mathcal{M}$ and $e(\mathcal{M})\subset\mathcal{C}$. Also note that up to now we haven’t mentioned anything about security: after all, we can take $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}$, $e=d=id$ in the definitions above.

    <p>An encryption function is a way to transform a sequence of characters into another sequence of characters. We introduce some notation to formalize this a little bit. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the set of all sequences of characters that you care about (for example, $\mathcal{M}$ may be the set of all strings of ASCII characters of arbitrary length or the set of all string of zeros and ones of length $256$). These sequences of characters are often called <em>plaintexts</em>. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the set of all encrypted messages, i.e. another set of sequences of characters. These are called <em>cyphertexts</em>. Then an encryption function is just a function $e:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{C}$ (<em>e</em> stands for “encrypt”). 
To upgrade an encryption function to an encryption <em>scheme</em>, one needs also a way to decrypt encoded messages: that is, a function $d:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{M}$. The obvious requirement is that the decryption recovers the original message, namely, $d(e(m)) = m$ for all $m\in\mathcal{M}$. Note that this implies that $e$ defines a bijection between $\mathcal{M}$ and $e(\mathcal{M})\subset\mathcal{C}$. 
<!-- For many practical purposes, this is not good: to encode all $n$-bit strings we will need to use also strings of length $\ge n$. So perfect recoverability (i.e. $d\circ e = id$) may be too strong.  -->
Also note that up to now we haven’t mentioned anything about security: after all, we can take $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}$, $e=d=id$ in the definitions above.<br />
In the final definition, the functions will actually be algorithms (we want the encryption to be computable), of polynomial-time complexity (efficiently computable). For technical reasons, they will be probabilistic algorithms. For a formal definition of probabilistic algorithms see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine">wikipedia</a> - basically it is a Turing machine that at each state tosses a coin to determine which of two transition functions it follows.</p>

<p><strong>Keys.</strong>  Assume we have two PPT (probabilistic polynomial-time) algorithms $\mathtt{Encode}$ and $\mathtt{Decode}$, corresponding to the functions above. In modern cryptography, we require that all algorithms be publicly known <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In view of this, these two algorithms do not suffice to provide a secure scheme if a sender wants to send a secret to a receiver over an insecure channel (insecure channel means that the cyphertext can be intercepted by an attacker): the attacker would simply run $\mathtt{Decode}$ on the cyphertext and recover the secret. There must be some data that distinguishes the receiver by any other entity: this piece of data is called key. We denote the set of keys by $\mathcal{K}$ (again some set of sequences of characters).</p>

<p><strong>Security parameter.</strong> Thus, the third component of an encryption scheme will be a PPT algorithm that generates a key or keys. This component is common to practically every protocol in cryptography. The key-generation algorithm takes as input a positive integer $\lambda$, called <em>security parameter</em>, in the form of a string of ones of length $\lambda$, denoted by $1^\lambda$. Most of the time this integer is correlated to the “complexity” of the key, for example its length.</p>

<p><strong>The formal definition.</strong> A private-key encryption scheme is a triple $(\mathtt{GenerateKey, Encode, Decode})$ of PPT algorithms such that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>$\mathtt{GenerateKey}(1^\lambda) = sk\in \mathcal{K}$. Here $\lambda\in\mathbb{N}$ is the security parameter and sk is the secret key.</li>
  <li>$\mathtt{Encode}$ and $\mathtt{Decode}$ have inputs in $\mathcal{K}\times\mathcal{M}$ and outputs in $\mathcal{C}$.</li>
  <li>For all $sk$ in the target of $\mathtt{GenerateKey}$ and for all $m\in\mathcal{M}$, \[P[ \mathtt{Decode}(sk,\mathtt{Encode}(sk,m)) = m ]=1,\] where the probability is taken over the randomness in the algorithms $\mathtt{Encode}$ and $\mathtt{Decode}$.</li>
</ol>
